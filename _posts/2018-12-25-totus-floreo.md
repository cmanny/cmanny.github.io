A song from a time long since gone...

The words "totus floreo" are repeated often and apparently means "I am all aflower", or "most full of life", I think, it is a nice phrase. *Totus floreo* for many will be in their 20s, but is a blessing if it returns.


Tempus est iocundum,  
o virgines,  
modo congaudete,  
vos iuvenes.  

Oh - oh, totus floreo,  
iam amore virginali  
totus ardeo,  
novus, novus amor est,  
quo pereo.  

Mea me comfortat  
promissio,  
mea me deportat  
negatio.  

Oh - oh, totus floreo,  
iam amore virginali  
totus ardeo,  
novus, novus amor est,  
quo pereo.  

Tempore brumali  
vir patiens,  
animo vernali  
lasciviens.  

Oh - oh, totus floreo,  
iam amore virginali  
totus ardeo,  
novus, novus amor est,  
quo pereo.  

Mea mecum ludit  
virginitas,  
mea me detrudit  
simplicitas.  

Oh - oh, totus floreo,  
iam amore virginali  
totus ardeo,  
novus, novus amor est,  
quo pereo.  

Veni, domicella,  
cum gaudio;  
veni, veni, pulchra,  
iam pereo.  

Oh - oh, totus floreo,  
iam amore virginali  
totus ardeo,  
novus, novus amor est,  
quo pereo.  

<!--
It is the time of joy, O maidens, now enjoy yourselves together, O young men.

Oh, oh, I am all aflower, now with my first love I am all afire, a new love it is of which I am dying.

I am elated when I say yes; I am depressed when I say no.

Oh, oh, I am all aflower, now with my first love I am all afire, a new love it is of which I am dying.

In the time of winter a man is sluggish, when spring is in his heart he is wanton.

Oh, oh, I am all aflower, now with my first love I am all afire, a new love it is of which I am dying.

My innocence plays with me, my shyness pushes me back.

Oh, oh, I am all aflower, now with my first love I am all afire, a new love it is of which I am dying.

Come, my mistress, with your joy *; come, come, fair girl, already I die.

Oh, oh, I am all aflower, now with my first love I am all afire, a new love it is of which I am dying.
