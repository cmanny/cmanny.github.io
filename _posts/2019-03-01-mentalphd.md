If you've never experienced mental breakdown, it's hard to imagine
the full destructive power of a damaged mental state. Stress, workload, personal affairs
and mental illness all interact at some physical level and result in our state of mind.
Those who know their self well are in a better position to handle strain in these areas
of life, however alone knowing your self is not enough to heal, you must also know
how to manage and alleviate the factors too. A PhD is a great example of a very personal,
intense undertaking where mental state is pretty much the source of all work produced. This
is contrast to the view that mental state is a factor alongside work; something that
must be cared for and respected, or work will suffer. If you wake up motivated and feeling
well every day you will produce your best work. Achieving this state is pretty difficult
for most as is found in all of our lives, but the importance, especially for this deep
technical work is the highest.

One very important factor that I have found is ignored is the way the work makes you
feel. If the work makes you feel unhappy, it is a clear sign to move on, no matter
what your supervisor or anyone else says. Also, if your supervisor doesn't really care
that you are not enjoying the work, it's probably time to jump ship. Self motivation
helps here, to have your own direction is important, but we all need supervision
in this deep context as getting lost is common. Doing deep work reflects not only
the way you think (how you solve a problem), but how your whole psychology permits you to
function. Ask yourself when you did your best work, or felt most pleased, how did that happen?
It's probably the most important question (In my experience I have no idea, also I
find these questions hard, but they are very much worth looking into). A lot of people
sacrafice their health for their PhD work, but there is always no benefit of such an approach.
Trust your instincts, if you think the direction is not right, move in your own way. Also,
don't be afraid to speak, this time is important for developing debate of all details, discover
what brings out the most interesting parts of the work. But, additionally, you cannot think too much
about to ask or say because really you must focus on the task itself. Clearly the PhD is
an impossible scenario (not really, but I think it's like flying a plane upside down and
landing on the atmosphere; yeah, still haven't figured it out).

But when the work takes hold of you, and you become obsessed, fully driven, it's fun. This
is where health starts to decline. As soon as you start thinking and working hard, mental
health declines, simply as a result of energy expenditure. Try staying up for several days
without sleeping, and have someone observe you or attempt to yourself, your entire mental state
is different, you'll act different and say different things. Heavy work has some other dimensions
to this but it's quite similar, your synapses get tired just like your muscles. Watch now
as you spend months on a particular problem you think has promise, as you see people less,
dump all your hobbies and other interests, as your entire mental state changes and you
cannot notice. Imagine you are a powerful emperor of philosophy, guarded by thousands of soldiers who
protect your thoughts, then one day you walk out to find they are all gone and your land has been
invaded by all these strange mad thoughts which you have to round up and deal with somehow. Suddenly everything looks
different and if you are even blind to that fires will start and the whole city within your mind will
collapse into ruin, or mental break. You're not the same any more, everything is destroyed and you want it
to be like it was before but the truth is it will take time to rebuild and that is the first thought you need (I
am actually telling you that is your first thought, you have no choice on that one). From here you must
fall back to some other lands where you will be able to recover, usually with help of others. You account
for the damage and prioritise clear thinking and realistic goals. Further down the line you will think about
how to defend yourself (from the world, and yourself) moving forward.

Thanks for reading, and I wish you luck on your path.
